```

### Main Orchestrator (`FitLoopOrchestrator`)

The main orchestrator coordinates all subsystems to provide seamless user experiences:

```typescript
class FitLoopOrchestrator {
  async processRequest(request: OrchestrationRequest): Promise<OrchestrationResponse>;
  async initializeUser(userProfile: UserProfile): Promise<InitializationResult>;
  async getUserInsights(userId: string): Promise<UserInsights>;
  async processBatchRequests(requests: OrchestrationRequest[]): Promise<OrchestrationResponse[]>;
}
```

## Technical Specifications

### SOLID Principles Implementation

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Context management is separate from prompt generation
- Data processing is isolated from AI orchestration
- Learning systems are independent of core functionality

#### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- All components are open for extension through interfaces
- New AI services can be added without modifying existing code
- Additional data sources can be integrated through adapters
- Learning algorithms can be swapped without system changes

#### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- All implementations are substitutable for their interfaces
- Mock implementations can replace real services for testing
- Different AI providers implement the same service interface
- Data sources are interchangeable through consistent APIs

#### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Interfaces are focused and specific to client needs
- Large interfaces are broken into smaller, focused ones
- Clients only depend on methods they actually use
- Optional features are separated into distinct interfaces

#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concretions
- All dependencies are injected through constructors
- Configuration is externalized and injectable
- Database and external service dependencies are abstracted

### Data Flow Architecture

```
User Request → Orchestrator → Context Analysis → Route Decision
                    ↓
        [Image Analysis] ← → [AI Generation] ← → [Context Processing]
                    ↓
            Response Assembly → Learning Update → Response Delivery
```

### Error Handling Strategy

1. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating with reduced functionality
2. **Intelligent Fallbacks**: Alternative processing paths when primary fails
3. **Context-Aware Recovery**: Recovery strategies based on user context
4. **Learning from Failures**: Error patterns feed into improvement algorithms

### Performance Optimization

1. **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching for prompts, responses, and context
2. **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent execution of independent operations
3. **Resource Pooling**: Connection and computation resource management
4. **Adaptive Scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation based on load

### Security & Privacy
